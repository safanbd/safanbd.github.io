            <h2>Preserving Peace in the Region</h2>
            <p>There is a good reason to travel back in time at Al Mirgab Military Camp: the camphas spearheaded a central role in preserving peace in the region for decades and witnessed a number of political events that led to the establishment of the Federation. In 1967, Al Mirgab camp was chosen as the new headquarters of the Trucial Oman Scouts, the paramilitary force established by the British government to preserve the internal security and stability in the Trucial States. In doing so, the camp completes an important chapter in the recent history of the UAE and contributed to the evolution of a vibrant community that drove Sharjah forward into the future.</p>
            <p>Forming a formidable first line of defence for Sharjah, the camp is strategically located on Ajman border on flat land at the edge of the Historic Town of Sharjah. The camp also enjoys swift access to both the sea and desert.</p>
            <p>A testament to old military architecture, a historic 19th century watchtower proudly stands in the camp till today. The tower differs from the other structures in the camp in terms of typology and in the choice of materials that went into its construction. Its continued presence stands as a poetic witness to the changing of the times, and the evolution of traditional structures to modern ones.</p>
            <h2>Upgrading the Dreams of Society</h2>
            <p>In addition to being a fortified military base, Al Mirgab became a mixed-use space that had a tremendous impact on the development of a close-knit community, where locals, Arabs and westerners lived in harmony. The availability of water drove many people to Al Mirgab during the dates’ harvest season in summer.</p>
            <p>A melting pot of cultures that thrived on its fertile land, the camp improved the lives and socio-economic status of many UAE residents, who went beyond traditional tribal loyalties and expanded a sense of belonging in the community, proudly integrating into the modern social fabric that upholds the values and traditions of the past.</p>

            <h2>Built for a Function</h2>
            <p>The location of the camp was identified for the following reasons: it was surrounded by an open, flat area; it had available water resources; and its strategic location on the border of Ajman helped improve communication with other states. The site was also chosen for its access to both sea and the desert, and its location away from the main urban area of Sharjah.</p>
            <h2>Leaps in Technology</h2>
            <p>Al Mirgab’s establishment bolstered communication systems for training, radio broadcasts, medical and technical reasons.The radio tower was amongst the first nodes of access to international news for the local residents.</p>
            <p>The machinery used to generate power in the power station was actually common in ships, and was reconfigured for use as a power generator.</p>
            <p>The cinema of the camp consisted of a large, white display screen attached on a flat wall with seating in front. The seating was semi-circular, embedded in the landscape. The cinema’s floor pattern is different from the rest of the camp, since it is made of concrete tiles with expansion gaps to fix the seats in place, elevating the spectators’ feet and keep the space clean.</p>

            <h2>Long Arm of the Law: Regional and International Significance</h2>
            <p>The camp is a testimony for cultural interchange between local and international cultures, seen through its foreign architecture but local context around a historic watchtower.</p>
            <p>The historic watchtower was built in the first half of the 19th century. It is traditional in terms of typology, materiality and construction techniques. It was once mainly used for surveillance.Although abandoned and unused by the military community today, the remains of the tower still stand in without any negative interventions.</p>
            <p>Al Mirgab has been witness to major political events leading up to and following the establishment of the Federation, and was a significant core for maintaining peace and security in the whole region of the Trucial States.</p>
            <p>The direct access to the sea also reflects a mediating function of the camp between the traditional political control of the Gulf through their navy, and its new role of patrolling desert areas, while the Trucial Oman States maintain order in the area.</p>
            <p>The significance of the camp is not associated with just its architectural conditions, but rather with its cultural and historical value. The value of the camp is associated with major events that transformed the history of the Emirate in socio-political terms.</p>
